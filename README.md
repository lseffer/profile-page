# Profile page

Here's a static profile page I've made. I took inspiration from a template on [styleshout.com](https://www.styleshout.com). 

Tools used:

* gulp
* npm
* sass

Basically it was my first time using Sass and so the files could be refactored and cleaned up a lot. I hacked this together in a few days.

## Installation:

Run

```
npm install
```

and followed by 

```
./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
```
