          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a natural problem solver with passion for machine learning, AI, applied statistics and programming. Having an impact is what drives me and is a source for great professional satisfaction.
            I am a big believer in life-long learning and therefore I actively develop my skills on my free time.
            Privately I enjoy the simple pleasures of life such as conversing with friends and hanging out with my dog and girlfriend. I like to stay active through floorball practice, gym and long walks with my dog.

              <h2>Rovio Entertainment Corporation</h2>
              <p>
                I have developed, deployed and maintained machine learning / deep learning models in the cloud for use in the business. A big focus early at the company was proactive and reactive analyses of game data and A/B tests. Through these my team helped game teams make better data-driven decisions. I have also automated / migrated a lot of legacy code and models to the cloud. I've built built feature-rich, aggregate database table structures for various games and use cases. I am managing my business unit's automatic job executions and github repository.

              <h2>IF P&C Insurance</h2>
              <p>
                I was responsible for monthly reporting of KPIs and interpretation/presenting of results and implications to senior managers of the business area. I was also tasked with forecasting and planning the portfolio's future performance as well as proposing price actions. I developed new pricing models and validated their success, sometimes in collaboration with other analysts. I created automated reports from different datasources serving multiple stakeholders in the organisation. There was continuous analysis of the portfolio to find areas of improvement. I also did many ad-hoc analyses about customers, premiums and claims.
